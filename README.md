# Thesis 

## Probabilistic Graphical Methods for Stereo Disparity Estimation

### Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of my thesis project and their different stages as different files. My thesis makes use of the [DGM](http://research.project-10.de/dgmdoc/index.html) library and focuses on the improvement of stereo disparity estimation using probabilistic graphical methods. The stages are in different files in order to see the improvement after every stage. 

### Usage
Please install DGM on your machine. You can find the installation guidelines [here](http://research.project-10.de/dgmdoc/a01843.html).
You can use any of the stages as a substitue for Demo Stereo. 

### The Stages
0. Demo Stereo Original with error estimation development
1. Demo Stereo 0 with node potential development
2. Demo Stereo 1 with parameter estimation development
